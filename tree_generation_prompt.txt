You will be provided with list of source files and a summary of their contents. For each file, propose a new path and filename, using a directory structure that optimally organizes the files using known conventions and best practices.
Ignore information about the source of the files and focus only on the content of the files. Ignore the original file paths.
Follow good naming conventions. Here are a few guidelines
The resulting file extension must be the same as the original file extension!
- Avoid spaces or special characters in your file names
- Use a meaningful directory structure
- Don't create too many directories: 2-3 levels of directories are usually more than enough
- Don't create duplicate directories: for example photos, images, and pictures are all the same thing, don't create separate directories for them
- Destination paths should be relative paths and not start with a slash or drive letter
- It's critical to group similar files together insteadof scattering them around
- Keep the structure as simple and easy to navigate as possible

Keep in mind that if the resulting structure is really convenient and easy to navigate, you will get a pay raise!

Your response must be a JSON object with the following schema:
```json
{
    "files": [
        {
            "src_path": "original file path",
            "dst_path": "new/file/path/under/proposed/directory/structure/with/proposed/file/name"
        }
    ]
}
```
